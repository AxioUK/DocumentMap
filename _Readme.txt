Document Map v1.5                                    By Pedro Aguirrezabal (Shagratt@ARG)
===========================================================================================
It display graph colored representation of the current code window wich can be clicked to navigate from
one point of the code to another instantly
It shows what part of the code you're seeing in the editor.
Its flicker free!
It has checks to not redraw when there is no code/views changes (its fast and not cpu intensive)
Default Colors:
   -Grey: Normal code
   -Light Grey: Begin of sub/function
   -Green: Comments

Left Click jump to that part of code.
Right click brings a menu to add/remove marks:
Cause I dont know how to access the Flags/Breakpoints I added a few special delimiters
that draw visual clues on the Document Map. (Must be the first chars in the line, except TODO)

   '*-  = Full purple line
   '*1  = Red mark on the right
   '*2  = Yellow mark on the right
   '*3  = Cyan mark on the right
   'TODO: = Shorter green mark on the right

   (Marks are part of the code so, unlike bookmarks, they are saved)

 IMPORTANT: While debuggin AddIns from the IDE I lost functionality of the right mouse (Definition,Last position,etc.)
 so before compiling do a backup of your registry key HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Visual Basic\6.0\UI
 If this happens to you deleting that key and reopening vb6 restore the lost functionality
 This does not happen if you compile the DLL and use the AddIn normally.
